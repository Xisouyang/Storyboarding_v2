### About
Storyboarding is an app that allows writers to quickly draft up/store ideas locally.

### How It Works

* Hit add button, select genre to write about

* See which generated ideas spark inspiration

* Edit ideas you like, delete ones you don't by swiping left on the card

* Add new card with the add button on each section

* Hit save button once you're happy with the story. Give it a title, see it appear on the list in 1st screen

* Go back to that story to edit whenever you want

* Able to delete any story on 1st screen by swiping left
